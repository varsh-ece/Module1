# Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to  print the account balance after withdrawal.
savingsbalance=5000

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
`````````````
Start
Set savingAmt = 5000
Read withd (withdrawal amount) from the user
Check if withd > savingAmt
If True â†’ Print "Insufficient balance"
If False â†’ Calculate balance = savingAmt - withd
Print "Account Balance: balance"

End
``````````````
## ðŸ§¾ Program
``````````````````
savingAmt=5000
withd=int(input())


if(withd>savingAmt) :
	print ("Insufficient balance")
else:
    print("Account Balance:",savingAmt-withd)
	
```````````````

## Output

## Result
thus to write a Python program to  print the account balance after withdrawal is compiled and the output is verified successfully.
