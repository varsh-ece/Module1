# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `1== True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `1== False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + 3`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 7`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## ðŸ’» Program
`````````````````

a = (1 == True)
b = (1 == False)
c = True + 3
d = False + 7
print("a is",a)
print("b is",b)
print("c:",c)
print("d:",d)
``````````````

## Output

## Result
thus to write a python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False` is compiled and the output is verified successfully.
