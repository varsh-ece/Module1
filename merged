# Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to  print the account balance after withdrawal.
savingsbalance=5000

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
`````````````
Start
Set savingAmt = 5000
Read withd (withdrawal amount) from the user
Check if withd > savingAmt
If True â†’ Print "Insufficient balance"
If False â†’ Calculate balance = savingAmt - withd
Print "Account Balance: balance"

End
``````````````
## ðŸ§¾ Program
``````````````````
savingAmt=5000
withd=int(input())


if(withd>savingAmt) :
	print ("Insufficient balance")
else:
    print("Account Balance:",savingAmt-withd)
	
`````````````````````````````

## Result
thus to write a Python program to  print the account balance after withdrawal is compiled and the output is verified successfully.



# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `1== True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `1== False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + 3`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 7`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## ðŸ’» Program
`````````````````

a = (1 == True)
b = (1 == False)
c = True + 3
d = False + 7
print("a is",a)
print("b is",b)
print("c:",c)
print("d:",d)
``````````````````````````

## Output
<img width="996" height="261" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c2b0558-dd6a-41c2-95fa-8523e5924e0c" />

## Result
thus to write a python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False` is compiled and the output is verified successfully.


# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters `'V'` and `'C'` using character literals.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Print the character `'V'`.
2. Print the character `'C'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```````````````
v = 'V'

w = "c"
 
print(v)
print(w)
```````````````

## Output
<img width="517" height="240" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a907de29-cce2-4b4c-8e17-951547ef73fd" />


## Result
 therefore to write a Python program that prints the characters `'V'` and `'C'` using character literals is compiled and the output
 is verified successfully

# ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## ðŸ’» Program
`````````````````
real=int(input())
imaginary=int(input())
comp=complex(real,imaginary)
print(comp)
print(float(comp.real))
`````````````````
## Output
<img width="748" height="293" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7215f9ce-b2c3-40dc-83df-a653a3c14dfa" />

## Result

therefore To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts is compiled and the output is verified successfully


# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```````
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
````````````

## Output
<img width="1028" height="287" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbe66c8f-4e7f-4481-bd64-0b9f27e83975" />


## Result
therefore To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it is compiled and the output is verified successfully
